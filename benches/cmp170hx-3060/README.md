# CMP 170HX (40 GiB, full unlock) + RTX 3060 — measured results

Numbers measured on the `raven-9950x` box. Every figure here supersedes the
modeled constants in `tenselerate/cli.py` and the estimates in
`docs/rig-cmp170hx-3060.md`; if they disagree, this file wins.

| date | quantity | value | how | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-07 | 170HX FP16 tensor throughput | 162-170 TFLOPS | FP16 GEMM bench on the box | dense A100 class; the 256-cycle MMA gate does not reproduce on this unit |
| 2026-09-07 | 170HX power limit | 250 W | `nvidia-smi` | earlier 100 W cap lifted |
| 2026-09-07 | 170HX PCIe | Gen2 x4 | `nvidia-smi` | OTP-fused; ~2 GB/s |
| 2026-09-07 | decode, wrong build (capacity-only throttle workarounds) | 22.5 tok/s | llama-server, single stream | card at 74 W / 83% util |
| 2026-09-07 | decode, normal sm_80 build, no spec | **33.3 tok/s** | llama-server, single stream, Q4_K_M, 2x256K slots, q4_0 KV | +48%; card at 218 W / 98% util; prompt 127 -> 158 tok/s on a short prompt |
| 2026-09-07 | MTP launch, first attempt | OOM | `cudaMalloc failed` allocating the MTP context | VRAM not freed from the previous server; clean relaunch succeeded at 29.6 GiB resident |

## What 33.3 tok/s says

30 ms per token. The weights alone are 16.5 GB, so the loop is achieving at most
**~550 GB/s on a short prompt (~37% of the 1493 GB/s nominal), ~710 GB/s if the
full 262K q4_0 window was being read (~48%)**. The planners assume 65%
(`BW_EFFICIENCY` in `tenselerate/cli.py`); the box does not deliver that yet.
The card reads 98% util while moving under half its bandwidth, which points at
kernel-side time (launch gaps, the GDN recurrence kernels, graph disablement)
rather than the HBM being the wall. Model prediction was ~45 tok/s; the gap is
the number to chase before any speculation lever.

## Diagnostics to run next (each answers one question)

1. `llama-bench -m <gguf> -ngl 999 -fa 1 -p 4096 -n 64` — `tg` at a short
   context is the pure weight-read rate (bytes / time = achieved GB/s);
   `pp` at 4096 tells whether prefill is really A100 class (expect >800 tok/s)
   or whether the s8 IMMA path is gated in practice despite the FP16 gpu-burn
   number. A 127-token prompt cannot answer that.
2. `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=clocks.mem,clocks.max.mem,clocks.sm --format=csv -l 1`
   during decode — is HBM at its max clock under load?
3. Server log with `--verbose`, grep `graph` — if CUDA graphs are being
   disabled for the hybrid graph, 64 layers of eager launches is a measurable
   slice of the 30 ms.
4. `svmi-bwprofile.py -m <gguf> --gpu cmp170hx-40` — persists the achieved
   GB/s so `plan`/`info` can stop using the 0.65 guess.

## Still to measure

- decode tok/s with `--spec-draft-n-max 5` (revised prediction from the measured
  30 ms pass: ~90-110 if acceptance is ~3 per pass; MTP running now)
- `svmi-cmpbench` npl curve (should be flat on this unit)
- MTP acceptance per draft position (`svmi-bitspec`)
- UD-Q4_K_M vs mixed-INT8; q8_0 vs q4_0 KV at the 262K window
